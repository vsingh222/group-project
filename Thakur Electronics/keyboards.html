        <h3>Logitech G513 Carbon</h3>
        <img class=Logitech src="images/Keyboards/Logitech.jpg" alt="Logitech" width="450px">
        <h2 class="price">Price: CDN$$149.00</h2>
        <p class="p2">
            In a crowded world of mechanical-switch gaming keyboards that all use the same handful of Cherry MX key-switch types (or Cherry MX knockoffs), the Logitech G513 Carbon ($149.99) stands out. Equipped with Logitech's own Lightsync RGB technology, a snug palm rest, and an anodized-aluminum finish that's cool to the touch, this flagship keyboard undercuts the suggested retail price of the Razer BlackWidow Chroma V2 while retaining most of its features. What's more, it comes in well below the Editors' Choice Corsair K95 RGB Platinum on street price, while carrying much of its charm. (We saw the G513 for as much as $50 less online, at this writing.) If you're willing to do without the dedicated macro keys and media controls of the sublime K95, it's a strong alternative.

        <h3>Roccat Vulcan 120 AIMO</h3>
        <img class=Roccat src="images/Keyboards/Roccat.jpg" alt="Roccat" width="450px">

        <p class="p2">
            When Roccat rolled out its Vulcan 120 AIMO ($159.99) mechanical gaming keyboard, we were initially skeptical. Our experience with the Roccat Horde AIMO$79.99 at Amazon before it was ho-hum; that model was a "mechanical/membrane" hybrid board whose media features didn't quite make up for the middling typing experience. It made us wonder what Roccat would bring this time, given that the Vulcan 120 AIMO would also be based on a new kind of key switch cooked up by the company. However, as it turns out, the Vulcan 120 AIMO is a much stronger effort, packing lots of gaming-keyboard goodness (dedicated media keys, a volume dial, RGB lighting) into a stylish, metal-plated body. It's just short of a star, and if you're loyal to Cherry MX key switches, you'll want to give it a pass, but it's otherwise a good model for first-person shooters and other fast-paced gaming genres.
